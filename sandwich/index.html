		<h3>WHY IS THE DETAIL OF THE SANDWICH IMPORTANT WHEN DISCUSSING HISTORY?</h3>
		
		<h5>By Ryan M., 1/17/2015, History 9</h5>

		<p>The sandwich is not important in the story as a whole, but in discussion of history as a whole it is vitally important. If more errors like this appear, they might be ones that are larger, and more could come up. The opinion expressed in the paper is that the sandwich shifts the focus away from the reasons that they might want to assassinate him at all. This promotes a more fatalistic view of events, in that the sandwich brought him in contact with Franz Ferdinand.</p>

		<p>The sandwich is also important in that it came (as far as the author of the article could tell) from a fictional piece written in recent years, promoted by a supposedly nonfiction documentary. This shows a critical deficiency in the fact-checking system, and citation system in recent years. The writer of that documentary was not keeping track of his sources well and therefore was unable to find where he got that fact, which as a result of his work has since entered the public's mind. The low age of that documentary shows how modern people are believing in everything that they read from supposedly reliable sources, and nobody (that has publicized their work) before this article has researched the origin of that fact that was never before seen.  </p>

		<p>Why would Princip and the others want to assassinate Franz Ferdinand? That is the question that the author of the article wants us to be asking. To me, not having read much about Serbia, Bosnia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it seems that it is the same reason that the USAians wanted to get rid of King George: so that they were not ruled by someone that did not have their interests in mind, not being a local. However, some may argue that killing Franz Ferdinand was a bad thing to do from their standpoint, as it would only anger his father, Archduke Karl Ludwig, and uncle, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria, and cause more harm to come to the Serbians and Bosnians. The assassination was probably inspired by the fact that it was much harder to get to Franz Joseph, as they were probably short on money and travel was difficult, as well as the fact that Franz Joesph I probably had much more security around him.</p>
