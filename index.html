<li>The rate of spread along Eurasia's east-west axis was on average 0.7 miles per year from the fertile crescent to the Indus river valley. The rate in the Americas, with their north-south axis was less than 0.5 miles per year.</li>
<li>The climate of Eurasia at the same lattitudes as the fertile crescent was much the same as it, and therefore the crops were able to spread very rapidly; they did not have to adapt to a new climate. They were also extremely useful.</li>
